            <h1>Reception</h1>
            <p class="mt-4">Super Smash Bros. Melee received critical acclaim from reviewers, most of whom credited
              Melee's expansion of gameplay features from Super Smash Bros. Focusing on the additional features, GameSpy
              commented that "Melee really scores big in the 'we've added tons of great extra stuff' department".
              Reviewers compared the game favorably to Super Smash Bros. IGN's Fran Mirabella III stated that it was "in
              an entirely different league than the N64 version"; GameSpot's Miguel Lopez praised the game for
              offering a more advanced "classic-mode" compared to its predecessor, while detailing the Adventure Mode as
              "really a hit-or-miss experience". Despite a mixed response to the single-player modes, many reviewers
              expressed the game's multiplayer mode as a strong component of the game. In their review of the game,
              GameSpy stated that "you'll have a pretty hard time finding a more enjoyable multiplayer experience on any
              other console".</p>
            <p>Melee's visuals garnered a positive reaction. GameSpot lauded the game's character and background models,
              stating that "the character models are pleasantly full-bodied, and the quality of their textures is
              amazing". IGN's Fran Mirabella III praised the game's use of physics, animation and graphics, although
              his colleague Matt Casamassina thought that "some of the backgrounds lack the visual polish endowed upon
              the characters" when giving a second opinion about the game.

              Critics praised the game's orchestrated soundtrack; while GameSpot's Greg Kasavin commented that
              "it all sounds brilliant". GameSpy praised the music for its nostalgic effect, with soundtracks
              ranging from multiple Nintendo series.</p>

            <p>Reviewers have welcomed the simplistic controls, but its "hyper-responsiveness", with the
              characters easily dashing and precise movements being difficult to perform, was expressed as a serious
              flaw of the game by GameSpot. With a milder criticism of controls, Bryn Williams of GameSpy commented
              that "movement and navigation seems slightly too sensitive". The basis of Melee's gameplay system is
              the battles between Nintendo characters, which has been suggested as being overly hectic; N-Europe
              questioned whether the gameplay is "too Frantic?", even though they enjoyed the variety of modes on
              offer. Similarly, Nintendo Spin's Clark Nielsen stated that "Melee was too fast for its own good", and
              "skill was more about just being able to wrap your head around what was happening as opposed to really
              getting into the combat". In regards to the pace of the game, Edge commented that it even made
              gameplay features such as "blocking" redundant, as the player is not given enough time to react to an
              attack.</p>
            <p>Despite the new features added to the game, some reviews criticized Melee for a lack of originality and
              for being too similar to its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Caleb Hale from GameCritics.com noted that
              while it was "every bit as good as its Nintendo 64 predecessor" he also felt "the game doesn't expand much
              past that point". On a similar note, Edge stated that "it's not evolution; it's reproduction", in
              reference to a perceived lack of innovation. The nostalgic nature of the game received a positive
              reaction, as well as the accompanying stages and items that allude to past Nintendo games. Gaming
              journalists have welcomed the roster of 26 Nintendo characters,as well as the trophy system,
              which Nintendo Spin labeled as "a great addition to this game".</p>

                <h1 class="card-title text-center"> AWARDS</h1>
                <p class="cr card-text">Several publications have acknowledged Super Smash Bros. Melee in competitions
                  and awards. In their "Best of 2001" awards, GameSpy chose it as Best Fighting GameCube Game,
                  IGN's reader choice chose it as Game of the Year, Electronic Gaming Monthly chose it as Best
                  Multiplayer and Best GameCube Game, and GameSpot chose it as the Best GameCube Game and tenth
                  best game of the year. The game received a nomination for "Console Fighting Game of the
                  Year" and "Outstanding Achievement in Animation" by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences,
                  which went to Dead or Alive 3 and Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. It also received a nomination in
                  GameSpot's "Best Music" and "Best Fighting Game" categories.

                  GameFAQs placed it sixth in a poll of the 100 best games ever and was in the final four of the
                  "Best. Game. Ever." contest. In the 200th issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, the editors
                  selected Melee as the 92nd most influential game in their "Top 200 Games of Their Time" list,
                  defining Melee as "Billions of things to unlock, plus Yoshi pummeling Pikachu with a bat". In a
                  similar competition, Nintendo Power named Super Smash Bros. Melee the 16th best game ever to appear
                  on a Nintendo console, and selected it as the 2001 "Game of the Year". IGN named it the third
                  best GameCube game of all-time in 2007 as a part of a feature reflecting on the GameCube's long
                  lifespan, citing it as "the grand stage of fighters, much like Mario Kart is for racing fans".
                  GameSpy chose it as fourth in a similar list, citing that it had "better graphics, better music,
                  more characters, more gameplay modes, more secrets to discover" in comparison to its
                  predecessor. The game was ranked 58th in Official Nintendo Magazine's "100 Greatest Nintendo
                  Games Ever" feature. In 2019, Game Informer ranked it as the 2nd best fighting game of all
                  time. Edge magazine ranked the game 91st on their 100 best Video Games in 2007.</p>

                <p class="cr card-text">When released in Japan, it became the fastest selling GameCube game with 358,525
                  units sold in the week ending November 25, 2001. This success continued as the game sold more
                  than a million units only two months after its release, making it the first GameCube title to reach
                  a million copies. The game also sold well in North America, where it sold 250,000-copies in nine
                  days. In the United States, Super Smash Bros. Melee was the 19th best-selling video game in 2001
                  according to the NPD Group.By July 2006, it had sold 3.2 million copies and earned $125
                  million in the United States alone. Next Generation ranked it as the fifth highest-selling game
                  launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that
                  country. Approximately 4.06 million units have been sold in the country as of December 27,
                  2007. With a software-to-hardware ratio of 3:4 at one time, some have attributed the
                  increasing sales of the GameCube near the launch date to Melee. As of March 10, 2008, Super
                  Smash Bros. Melee is the best-selling GameCube game, with more than seven million copies sold
                  worldwide. It has been estimated that at one point in time 70% of all GameCube owners also owned
                  Melee.</p>
